1. We have array of integers called nums, write a function to return all numbers (in a form
of array of integers) that when subtracted by any of integers in nums doesn't return
number that is < 0
for example : nums = [3,1,4,2], your output should be : [4], because when 4 is subtracted
by 3 or 1 or 4 or 2 doesn't return number that is < 0
2. We have array of integers called nums and an integer called x, write a function to return
all numbers (in a form of array of integers) that when divided by any of integers in nums
doesn't return x
for example : nums = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, your output should be : [1,2,3], because only 4
divided by 1 is 4 (x)
3. We have a string called word and an integer called x, write a function to return an array
of strings containing all strings that has length x.
for example : word = "souvenir loud four lost", x = 4, your output should be ["loud", "four",
"lost"] because those strings has length of 4
